## Project Title: Evolutionary Simulation Toolbox

Our Modelling Software is a Python package that provides a set of tools for simulating evolutionary processes. The package is designed to be user-friendly and flexible, allowing users to easily set up and run simulations of evolutionary processes. The package includes a number of built-in models for simulating different types of evolutionary processes, as well as tools for visualizing and analyzing simulation results. The package is designed to be extensible, allowing users to easily add new models and analysis tools.

### Factors we considered in designing the software:
1. **User-friendly interface**: We wanted to make the software as easy to use as possible, so we designed a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to easily set up and run simulations.
2. **Flexibility**: We wanted the software to be flexible enough to handle a wide range of evolutionary processes, so we designed it to be easily extensible.
